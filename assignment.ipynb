    "## Exploratory Data Analysis Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You will pick a real-world dataset of your choice and apply the concepts learned in this course to perform exploratory data analysis. Use the Exploratory Data Analysis class project as an outline for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset must contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows of data\n",
    "* You must ask and answer at least 4 questions about the dataset\n",
    "* Your submission must include at least 4 visualizations (graphs)\n",
    "* Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, apart from the code.\n",
    "* Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted for somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Select a real-world dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "- Find an interesting dataset on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv\n",
    "- The data should be in CSV format, and should contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows\n",
    "- Download the dataset using the [`opendatasets` Python library](https://github.com/JovianML/opendatasets#opendatasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some sample code for downloading the [US Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import opendatasets as od\n",
    "dataset_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset'\n",
    "od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas\n",
    "- Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.\n",
    "- Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data\n",
    "- Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns\n",
    "- Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.\n",
    "- Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.\n",
    "- Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset\n",
    "- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn\n",
    "- Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary\n",
    "- Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib etc. explain briefly what it does\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis\n",
    "- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections\n",
    "- Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets\n",
    "- Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Step 6: Write a blog post\n",
    "\n",
    "- A blog post is a great way to present and showcase your work.  \n",
    "- Sign up on [Medium.com](https://medium.com) to write a blog post for your project.\n",
    "- Copy over the explanations from your Jupyter notebook into your blog post, and [embed code cells & outputs](https://medium.com/jovianml/share-and-embed-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-jovian-ml-df709a03064e)\n",
    "- Check out the Jovian.ml Medium publication for inspiration: https://medium.com/jovianml\n",
